Title of project:
Pizza Store Order System

Project:
	We want to write a simple order system for a pizza store. 

Why interesting:
	We think it is interesting because it is useful in real life situation. It also can help us being familiar with different design pattern such as factory pattern and decorator pattern.

Tools:    
  We want to use c++, but we are open to java.

I/O:
There is no input required. The main class serves as a driver to test all the funtions and simulate a pizza order situation, which includes order a base pizza and add add-on to the pizza and calculate the correct price for the pizza with all add-ons. The consule output shows the result.
