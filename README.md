Title of project:
Hotel management system

Project:
	We want to write a simple hotel management system that can keep tracking the room occupancy and provide check-in and check-out function. 

Why interesting:
	We think it is interesting because it is useful in real life situation. It also can help us being familiar with different design pattern. For example, when we create a room, we might use factory pattern. Each room can have some add-on service such as TV, internet service, food, which can be accomplished by using decorator pattern. When a customer checkout, he or she can choose different payment methods such as cash or credit card, which involves strategy pattern. 

Tools:    
  We want to use c++, but we are open to java.

I/O:
Input are console input, which simulate create a hotel and rooms with different price, it also simulates check-in and checkout of a customer. The output will be the available room, balance, etc.
